## Features + Example JSON requests

### Feature One: Users
This functionality deals with user management so that players can save their progress. It takes in a users’ name as the input, generates a unique username for the user, and then creates a user profile that will be stored on the database. To update a user, the user’s username and what needs to be updated is passed in as input, and the user profile will be updated on the database. To delete a user, pass in the unique username of the user, and the user profile will be deleted on the database.

#### Front End Features

Enter any nickname that you would like to use and the system will give you an unique username that could be used to identify you when you log in. Please copy your given username to test the next functionality.

### Feature Three: Game
This functionality contains the core gameplay elements. It outputs random trash for the user to sort in a session, then processes a user’s score from the session, updating the global and user counts. The progress against the global count remaining trash can be seen by other users.

#### Front End

#### Game
Access this using the link https://dumpster-divers.herokuapp.com/game or click on the Dive In! button on the homepage. When you press Let’s Dive, the timer begins to count down and you’re given a random trash to sort. You may choose to put it into either of the bins. If you put it in the correct bin, your tally counter increments by one. If you put it into the wrong bin, you will be greeted with a modal that tells you where you went wrong and the game ends immediately. The game also ends when your timer runs out. 

#### User Session
The amount of trash you recycled this session will be displayed on the post game screen on your diver certification card immediately after your round. This amount is both added to your records (if you’re logged in) and decremented from the global count. Players who are not signed in are prompted to do so in order to save their progress.


#### Global Count 
The global count is a real time tally displayed on the homepage. After finishing a round your score is subtracted from the global count and you will be able to see the changes on the homepage.
